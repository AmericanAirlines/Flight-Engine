## Testing

This project utilizes framework uses Facebook's [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) framework for testing.

Writing a test is as simple as creating a `*.test.ts` file in the `./src` directory along with an associated `describe()` and `it()` function.

Simply run `npm run test` to run the existing test suite or use it to execute your own tests once you've created new ones.

Additional testing scripts:

- `test`: runs all tests
- `test:changed`: runs tests related to uncommited git changes only
