# Running the App Locally

First, make sure you have [Node.js (which includes `npm`)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then navigate to the project directory and install project dependencies by running `npm install`.

After dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev` to start the app. Once the app has started, try going to `localhost:3030` from a browser. When you're ready to start getting data, see the [Retrieving Data](#retrieving-data) and [Modifying Flight Engine](#modifying-flight-engine) sections.

## Retrieving Data

Once the app is running (either locally or in a cloud environment - e.g., `your-app.herokuapp.com` or `localhost:3030`) navigate to its URL in a browser and you should see a "👋". To start retrieving flight information, make a `GET` request to `/flights` with a `date` query parameter and a date value with the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. For example, `your-app.herokuapp.com/flights?date=2020-01-01` will return flight details for January 1st, 2020. If you'd like to specify an origin or a destination, use the `origin` and/or `destination` query parameters with an airport code as the value; for example, `your-app.herokuapp.com/flights?date=2020-01-01&origin=DFW&destination=LGA` will retrieve flights from DFW to LGA on January 1st, 2020.

### Explore the app with Postman

A quick way to start exploring the app is to use Postman. [Download the app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and import the `Flight Engine.postman_collection.json` Postman collection contained within this project. After importing, you can edit the collection and modify the `baseURL` variable if you've deployed to a cloud environment if needed.

The collection contains several example requests, including `/flights` and shows how to request data from the API, including the use of the `date`, `origin`, and `destination` query parameters.

## Modifying Flight Engine

You can customize Flight Engine to tweak existing routes, add data, or even add new routes so it can be used as your app's backend.

### Adding a new Route

If you want to create a new API route, use the `app` variable defined within/exported from `src/app.ts` and follow the documentation for [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) to create a new listener. For example, you could create the `/theMeaningOfLife` endpoint by adding the following code to `src/app.ts` (at the bottom but above `export default app;`):

```typescript
app.get('/theMeaningOfLife', (_: express.Request, res: express.Response): void => {
  res.send('42');
});
```

You could also create a new file and consume that route from within `src/app.ts`:

```typescript
// src/theMeaningOfLife.ts
import express from 'express';

export default function theMeaningOfLife(_: express.Request, res: express.Response): void {
  res.send('42');
}

// src/app.ts
import theMeaningOfLife from './theMeaningOfLife';
// ...
app.use('/theMeaningOfLife', theMeaningOfLife);
```

### Randomization via a Seed Value

In order to keep the app lightweight and eliminate the need for a database, this project uses [_seed randomization_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) (credit to [@JohnKahn](https://github.com/johnkahn) for the amazing idea!). If you plan to modify routes that use flight data, make sure to read this content carefully as it is critical in order to maintain data integrity.

Here are some important things to note if you plan to modify the random data generation:

- After a `Generator` is initialized with a `seed`, the `random` method will generate random data each time it is called, however, this data generation is _deterministic_...
- Because this method of random generation is _deterministic_, the _order_ and _value_ of the "random" value sets generated by multiple calls to `random` for a given seed will _always_ be the same
  - That was a lot... let's say we have `generatorA` and `generatorB` and each have been initialized with a seed value of `RANDOMIZATION_IS_COOL!`. If we call the `random` method of each generator (e.g., `A1` and `B1`), the result will be _the same_ (`A1 === B1`). If, however, we call the `random` method again, the new values will again be the same (`A2 === B2`) but they _should_ differ from the first set of values generated by each of the generators (`A1 !== A2 && B1 !== B2`).
- Whenever a `GET /flights` call is performed, the app generates _all_ flights for the specified `date`, _regardless_ of the presence of `origin` and/or `destination`
  - If we only generate a subset of the data based on origin and/or destination, the order in which the flights generated for each O&D pair would differ and flight data would be different depending on the request parameters (e.g., flight `123` retrieved via`/flights?date=2020-01-01` and `/flights?date=2020-01-01&origin=DFW` would differ). Here's an example:
    - `random` method calls 1-10 with a seed of `2020-01-01` will _ALWAYS_ result in: `[1, 7, 9, 1, 8, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3]`
    - `/flights?date=2020-01-01`:
      1. Generate LGA flights (`random` calls 1-4)
      1. Generate MIA flights (`random` calls 6-7)
      1. Generate DFW flights (`random` calls 8-10), flight `123` was call 9 and got a random value of `2`
    - `/flights?date=2020-01-01&origin=DFW`:
      1. Generate DFW flights (`random` calls 1-3), flight `123` was call 2 and got a random value of `7`
    - Because the values are different, the data for flight 123 will not be the same for those two calls
